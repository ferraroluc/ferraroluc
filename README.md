# Profile
During my time at the University, I focused my career on telecommunications and computer science. That is why today I dedicate myself to design and development IT infrastructures.
Currently, I am part of the Redjar worker cooperative, working as a Backend developer and DevOps. In addition, I coordinate the Technical Support area and the IoT team.
