My name is Lucas and I am an electronic engineer. I consider myself passionate about computer science and telecommunications. For this reason, today I am dedicated to design and development of IT infrastructures. Anyway, I always like to keep learning and expand into other areas, such as programming and cybersecurity.
I am currently part of a work cooperative called Redjar, working as a Backend developer and DevOps. In addition, I coordinate the Technical Support area and the IoT team.
